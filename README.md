# Codes for 'distance-based quantum classifiers'

- DBQC folder contains the codes used to replicate the results of 'Implementing a distance-based classifier with a quantum interference circuit' by Schuld, Fingerhuth and Petruccione (2017) (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10793.pdf).
    - dbqc.py: contais the main code to create the circuit of the classifier
    - dbqc_experiment.py: contains the codes for classifying iris dataset
